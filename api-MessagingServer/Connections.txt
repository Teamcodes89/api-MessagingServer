For starting the connection to the server the URL is:
ws://localhost:51234/api/connections/connect

then you have to send a message to inform the number this will be in RSA2 encryption algorithm but for now just being in plain text will be ok.

the message has to be a json like this:

{
    "PhoneNumber": "<number>"
}
